How to test:
1. Download the code and data. Include the code folder to the MATLAB path.
2. Change the parameters in the file InSegtCone_input.m

Note:
The mex files in the code were tested on Windows 64 bit. You might need to compile again on your system.

Data:
Can be downloaded here https://www.morphosource.org/projects/000377798?locale=en

You have to have one label file to allow the fitting of the eye shape in order to unfold the curved eye.

To do:
1. add extra data input format
2. add eye shape analysis function
3. clean the labels
4. add semi automatic lens surface segmentation
5. GUI
